Standardizing rsa/aes stuff on pycrypto for python3 compatibility, but
using pycrypto v2.6 for pkcs1_oacp support. Precise does not have this yet.

Installing Ubuntu 12.04 requirements:

apt-get install python3-setuptools build-essential python3-dev libgmp-dev
python3 -m easy_install pip
pip-3.2 install pycrypto (or install --upgrade if you already installed the 2.4 package via apt-get)
